# Devon Wells' Portfolio

Hi, this is my WIP personal portfolio. It's a funny thing, a portfolio. Somehow I end up making a new one every year in a different context for fun. My wife calls me dumpling, hence the name.  I'm a developer in the Columbus, OH area. For more information, feel free to check out my portfolio. Oh, wait... it's still in progress. Right, I'll get right on that.

I can be reached for inquiries at devon.wells.a@gmail.com.

## About

This portfolio was built with the React framework Next.js and Contentful CMS. Styles are CSS-in-JS via TailwindCSS (though this will likely change to Chakra shortly).

*Currently, the portfolio is in development. Check back again later.*

## TODO

- Add favicon
- Add content (migrate from Medium?)
- Update components
- Strip unnecessary component
- Redo landing page
- Redo posts page
